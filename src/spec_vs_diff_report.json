  "summary": "REQ-55 is not verifiably implemented as specified (moving exactly the four XPath-identified elements as a consecutive group to the end of their current parent while leaving everything else unchanged). The diff indicates multiple unrelated changes across styling/config/components (and likely layout/behavior), which conflicts with the constraint/AC that nothing outside the selected elements be moved/restyled/changed.",

      "id": "REQ-55",
      "requirement": "Move the four selected elements (exact XPaths given) so they appear together as the last content within their current parent container, preserving their internal order and without changing any other parts of the page.",
      "reason": "The diff does not show any explicit, targeted movement of the four XPath-specified nodes as a group within the same parent; instead it shows broader page/layout/styling updates (e.g., new share-link shell behavior and extensive CSS/Tailwind changes), which violates the requirement’s constraint/AC that no other content be moved/restyled/changed.",
