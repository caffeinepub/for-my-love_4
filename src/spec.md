# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Move four specific existing elements so they appear together as the last content within their current parent container.

**Planned changes:**
- Reorder the four elements identified by the provided XPaths so they render consecutively as a group at the bottom of their current parent container.
- Preserve the internal (relative) order of the four moved elements and leave all other page content unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** The selected four elements appear together at the end of their current section/container (not before other sibling content), with no other visible changes to the page.
